            Hello everyone! My name is Trevor,
            and starting today,
            24 July, 2021,
            I am officially the owner of Fivnex. Kai, our former CEO/Founder,
            has decided to continue her work on the <a href="https://potabi.com/">Potabi</a> project,
            without having the overhead of managing this company.
            Potabi, unfortunately, is no longer an official Fivnex product.
            I cannot provide any more information about Kai or Potabi at this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, we have lost our LLC status,
            as the legal hurdles in maintaining and transferring the LLC is something nobody wanted to go through.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our subsidiary Ceccun,
            has decided to operate independently from us.
            Again,
            I cannot provide any information about Ceccun at this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            With all that being said,
            I am uncertain as to what the future of Fivnex will hold.
            There is a lot still to be decided,
            as well as a lot of things needing to be handled.
            Any new information or developments will be posted here,
            or to the <a href="https://twitter.com/Fivnex">Fivnex twitter account</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wish everyone who left us today the best of luck in their future endeavours.
            If you have any questions about Fivnex and it's future, you may contact me either at <a href="mailto:hello@trevorthalacker.com">hello@trevorthalacker.com</a>, through the Fivnex twitter, or through Discord.
          </p>
